# EasyJournal - Performance Optimization Guide

This document details the performance optimizations implemented in EasyJournal to ensure efficient operation, especially under heavier loads.

## Recent Performance Optimizations

### Before Request Handlers

The system uses Flask's `before_request` handlers to set up each request. These have been optimized for improved performance:

1. **System Settings Loading**
   - Implemented SQL query optimization with `with_entities` to fetch only needed columns
   - Added expanded path exclusions to skip unnecessary processing for static resources
   - Improved caching mechanism to reduce database queries
   - Added attribute existence checking to prevent attribute errors

2. **GDPR Consent Checking**
   - Restructured with early returns to minimize unnecessary processing
   - Improved path filtering for better performance
   - Added proper authentication state checking before expensive operations
   - Moved large text constants to config.py to reduce handler complexity

3. **Visitor Tracking**
   - Optimized SQL operations with minimal data storage
   - Implemented smarter session-based tracking to reduce database writes
   - Added extended path exclusions for admin routes and health checks
   - Implemented conditional imports to reduce unnecessary module loading
   - Simplified article view detection logic

### Configuration Improvements

1. **Default Text Templates**
   - Moved large text constants (like GDPR consent text) to config.py
   - Reduced memory usage in request handlers
   - Centralized text management for easier updates

## Cache Duration Settings

The system uses a 10-minute cache for system settings to balance freshness with performance. This duration can be adjusted in `app.py` by modifying the `_CACHE_DURATION` variable:

```python
_CACHE_DURATION = 600  # Default: 10 minutes in seconds
```

## Database Query Optimization

Several database queries have been optimized:

1. **System Settings**: Using optimized queries with only required columns
2. **Visitor Tracking**: Reduced data collection and storage to essential fields
3. **Session Management**: Implemented smart tracking to avoid duplicate entries

## Future Optimization Areas

Areas that could benefit from further optimization:

1. **Analytics Dashboard**: Query optimization for report generation
2. **Admin Routes**: Refactoring large blueprint modules (especially admin.py)
3. **Plugin System**: Lazy loading of plugins as needed
4. **SQL Query Caching**: Implementing query result caching for frequently accessed data

## Performance Monitoring

To monitor EasyJournal's performance:

1. **Server Logs**: Watch for slow database queries or high response times
2. **Database Performance**: Use PostgreSQL's query analyzer for complex queries
3. **Application Profiling**: Use Python profiling tools to identify bottlenecks

## Best Practices

1. **Avoid Heavy Processing in Request Handlers**: Defer processing when possible
2. **Use SQL Query Optimization**: Always fetch only required columns
3. **Implement Path Exclusions**: Skip processing for static files and health checks
4. **Prioritize Early Returns**: Structure code to exit early when possible
5. **Implement Proper Caching**: Use caching for frequently accessed data
